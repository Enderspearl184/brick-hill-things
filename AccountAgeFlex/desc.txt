Don't be toxic to anyone regardless of account age.

Score is account age in days. (May be off by one.)

If the Green Tower doesn't work for you, view your profile on brick-hill.trade and rejoin.

The Regular Tower requires a 2019 account. Each level up this tower requires an account made the year before the last.

The Small Tower requires a Brick Hill Membership. Each level up this tower requires a higher level membership.

The Green Tower requires 100 value. (on brick-hill.trade) Each level up this tower requires 10 times the value as the last.

The White Box is entirely luck. When you join the set, you have an approximately 1/1000 chance to be randomly allowed in.

The Pink Box requires being a Brick Hill admin or moderator.

The Gold Box requires having the Brick Saint award.

Thanks to Moor for doing the interior of the tower!
