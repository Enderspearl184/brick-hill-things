# so what the hell is this??

Since Brick Hill has gone offline (likely permanently), i thought i'd post my game scripts and other shenanigans here for the world to see!!

BE WARNED THE CODE IS KINDA SHIT

if the site returns, feel free to use these scripts to create your own games, though if i decide to host them again maybe don't post an *exact* copy of them, be creative! :)

also, all player data has been removed, along with the node modules so you'll need to reinstall them.
IF YOU WANT YOUR PLAYER DATA FROM ANY OF MY GAMES JUST ASK ME :D
